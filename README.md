# Angular Rome

AngularJS directive for displaying Rome.

## What Makes it different?

When specifying input format, Rome always want the input date to be converted to the input format.
It means that if you have date from database which has ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss), you must convert it first for Rome.
This directive will help you to keep using standard format because it will ask input and give output in ISO date time format.
